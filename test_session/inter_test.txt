Write a program that prompts the user to enter a sentence, and then counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and consonants in the sentence. The program should print out the counts for each vowel and consonant.

Here are the steps to complete the task:

Use the input() function to prompt the user to enter a sentence.
Convert the sentence to lowercase using the lower() method to make it easier to count the vowels.
Initialize variables to keep track of the counts for each vowel and consonant, and set them to zero.
Use a for loop to iterate over each character in the sentence.
Use an if statement to check whether the character is a vowel. If it is, increment the count for that vowel.
If the character is not a vowel, use another if statement to check whether it is a consonant. If it is, increment the count for consonants.
Print out the counts for each vowel and consonant.
