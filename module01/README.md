# INTRODUCTION
A common task is developing programs that can not only show information on a screen or a console, but also take input from users or even other programs. In this module, you'll build your first program in Python to learn how to handle input and output on the console. You'll also learn Python programming concepts, like variables and converting between data types.

# What will you learn?

In this module, you'll learn to:

 - Use functions to manage input and output to the console
 - Create variables to store data
 - Distinguish between data types
 - Use type conversion to convert between data types
 - Use conditional statements
 - importing modules/packages inside your python code

# Steps

## Create a Python file
To create a program in Python, you need to store it in a file. The file should have the extension .py.

The idea of a program is to do something or carry out a task. To have the program do something, you'll need to add the statements or instructions to perform the task. For example, an instruction could print some text or calculate something. 

## Let's say Hello to the World!
One of the first things you're likely to do is print to a console. On the console, you can run commands and programs. You can also enter information and show information as text on the screen.

To write information to the console, you can use the print() function and implement it as a core function. Because it's a core function, you'll have access to it if Python is installed. To use print() in your program, give it an argument.

Refer to first_program.py for code details.

## Declare Variables

To get anywhere with coding, you need to understand that you're operating on data. As your program is working on data, you might need to remember a certain value throughout the program's execution. For that, you use variables.

To get hands on variable refer to variable.py
