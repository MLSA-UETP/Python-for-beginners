# INTRODUCTION
A common task is developing programs that can not only show information on a screen or a console, but also take input from users or even other programs. In this module, you'll build your first program in Python to learn how to handle input and output on the console. You'll also learn Python programming concepts, like variables and converting between data types.

# What will you learn?

In this module, you'll learn to:

 - Use functions to manage input and output to the console
 - Create variables to store data
 - Distinguish between data types
 - Use type conversion to convert between data types
 - Use conditional statements
 - importing modules/packages inside your python code
