What is the result of the following code snippet?

x = 5
y = 2
print(x % y)

A) 2
B) 1
C) 0
D) 2.5

Answer: B) 1. The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder when one number is divided by another. In this case, 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1.

Which data type is used to represent a value that can either be True or False?

C) bool
D) string

What is the output of the following code snippet?

x = 5
y = 2
x /= y
print(x)

A) 5
B) 2.5
C) 3
D) 2

Answer: B) 2.5. The shorthand operator "/=" is an assignment operator that divides the value of the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side and then assigns the result to the variable on the left-hand side. 
So, in this case, x /= y is equivalent to x = x / y, which results in x being assigned the value 2.5.

Which of the following is NOT a valid data type in Python?
A) int
B) float
C) bool
D) char
Answer: D) char. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not have a data type called "char" to represent single characters.
Instead, you can use a string data type to represent a single character as a string with a length of 1.

What is the output of the following code snippet?


x = 10
y = 5
if x > y:
  print("x is greater than y")
else:
  print("y is greater than x")

A) x is greater than y
B) y is greater than x
C) 10
D) 5

Answer: A) x is greater than y. The conditional statement checks whether the value of x is greater than the value of y. 
Since x is indeed greater than y (10 > 5), the first print statement is executed, which outputs "x is greater than y".
